Questions:
1.Answer the questions
Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
2.Can this sequence be considered correct?
If the answer to the previous question is “no”, then what needs to be changed in it to make it correct?


Answer:
1.No. Reason - Number of brackets. 1 opening square brackets and two closing square brackets.
6 closing round brackets and only 5 closing round brackets.

2. I should validate if there is equity among the brackets.
There must be an equal number of opening and closing brackets, so we have a number of solutions:
1 -  Eliminate unpaired brackets - [(()())(())]
2 -  Add pair to brackets without a pair - [[((())()(()))]]
